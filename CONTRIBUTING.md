# Contributing to SPK Universal Timestamp

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this project! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or refining calendrical logic, your input helps improve the precision and utility of this framework.

## üß† Project Scope

This repository implements a universal timestamp system based on the *rata die* concept, spanning geological to cosmological time scales, with support for multiple calendar systems. Contributions should align with the project's goals of precision, reproducibility, and generalizability.

## üêû Reporting Bugs

Please use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/RoswellMiller/SPK_UniversalTimestamp/issues) and select the **Bug Report** template. Include:
- Version (e.g. `v1.0.0-beta`)
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Python version, calendar mode)

## üí° Suggesting Enhancements

Use the **Feature Request** template to propose:
- New calendar systems
- Improved timestamp logic
- Integration ideas for scientific datasets

Be clear about the motivation and scope of your suggestion.

## üì¶ Pull Requests

Before submitting a PR:
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch
- Follow existing code structure and naming conventions
- Include tests or validation logic if applicable
- Reference related issues in your PR description

## üìö Documentation Contributions

Improving clarity, structure, or examples in the README or supporting docs is highly encouraged. Please open an issue first if you're proposing major changes.

## üß™ Modeling Philosophy

This project values:
- The currently uses long integers and Decimal types for extra precision.  It expects to promote the improvement of these number types in Python much in the same way long intgers are now a standard.
- The project is attempting to implement the documented historical and cultural concept of time in calendrical standards. The objective is knowing when things happened in a way that allows comparativeness across time and culture.

If your contribution touches on these areas, include references and rationale.

## ü§ù Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure a respectful and inclusive environment.
